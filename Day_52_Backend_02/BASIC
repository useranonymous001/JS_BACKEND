        WORKING WITH NODE AND NPM
            # INITIALIZATION OF PROJECT
                - npm init -y (all defaults)


            # NODE BASIC USAGE
                - Go the Documentation section
                - Look for the modules and choose the calling methods (either using promise CJS or callback ESM)
                - Eg: const fs = require('fs'); // Using CJS (common JS)
                - Eg: const fs = require('node:fs');   // same as above
